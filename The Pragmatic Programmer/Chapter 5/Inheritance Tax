Page 158 - The problems of inheritance: Coupled code, the child classes are linked to the main class.

So in:
  
    class Vehicle {
      constructor(speed) {
        this.speed = speed;
      }

      speedUp() {
        this.speed + 1;
      }
    }

    class Car extends Vehicle {
      showInfo() {
        return `Driving at ${this.speed}km/h`
      }
    }

Car depends on the speed var provided by the Vehicle class, this generates coupling

How to avoid inheritance problems:
  - Interfaces;
  - Delegation;
  - Mixins And Traits;
