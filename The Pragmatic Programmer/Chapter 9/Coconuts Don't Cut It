Version Control: Just a version control system, like Git.

Regression Testing:

  We want to start testing as soons as we have code.

  Unit Tests - Tests the modules, one by one.

  Integration Tests - An expense of unit testing, it tests entire subsystems.

  Once a human tester finds a bug, it should be the last time a human teste finds that bug.
