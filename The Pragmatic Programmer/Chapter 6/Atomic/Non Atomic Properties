Atomic Properties:
  Given: point = CGPoint(x: 10, y: 10) and 3 threads

  Thread A tries to read the point;
  Thread B sets the point = CGPoint(x: 1, y: 1);
  Thread C sets the point = CGPoint(x: 5, y: 5);

  Thread A can return:
    { x: 10, y: 10 }
    { x: 1, y: 1 }
    { x: 5, y: 5 }


Non Atomic Properties:
  In the same situation, thread A returns an unknown value. Can be even { x: 5, y: 1 } since two threads are trying to set the value at the same time

Difference between Atomic and Non Atomic:
  Non Atomic set the property value directly and are faster. But returns a unknown value.

  Atomic uses locks to protect the set operation and returns a correct value. But are slower.
